## Star Wars Survey Data Analysis

This project analyzes FiveThirtyEight’s *Star Wars* survey dataset using Python and pandas. The goal is to clean real-world survey data and extract meaningful insights into fan film preferences and demographic trends.

### Key Objectives:
- Clean and transform messy data (e.g., Booleans, checkboxes, column renaming)
- Identify the most-viewed and highest-rated *Star Wars* films
- Explore how opinions vary across gender and education level

This hands-on project demonstrates essential data wrangling and analysis skills relevant to real-world data analyst roles.

📊 Visual Example: Average Film Rankings
This horizontal bar chart displays the average viewer ranking of each Star Wars film (Episodes I–VI), based on survey responses from FiveThirtyEight’s dataset.

Lower scores indicate higher favorability (1 = most liked, 6 = least liked).

Episode V (The Empire Strikes Back) emerged as the most popular film on average.

Episode III (Revenge of the Sith) received the lowest overall ranking.

The chart uses customized colors, background styling, and annotation to enhance readability and highlight the ranking logic (lower = better).

📊 Visual Example: Number of Respondents per Movie
This chart displays how many survey participants reported watching each of the six Star Wars films.

Episode III had the highest viewership among respondents, followed closely by Episodes II and I.

Episode V (The Empire Strikes Back)—despite being the most highly ranked—was seen by fewer respondents than the prequels.

This highlights a potential bias in ranking data: not all participants had seen every film, which may influence overall sentiment scores.

The chart uses a consistent horizontal bar format with clear axis labeling and color styling to communicate viewership differences effectively.

📊 Visual Example: Movie Rankings and Respondent Counts by Gender
This paired chart visualizes how Star Wars film rankings and viewership differ between men and women.

📈 Left: Average Movie Rankings by Gender
Women generally rated Episode 3 lower than men, while men tended to rate Episode 5 more favorably.

A lower score indicates a better ranking, highlighting subtle gender-based preferences in the saga.

📊 Right: Number of Respondents by Gender
More women reported watching each episode than men, with the biggest difference observed for Episode 5.

These differences may affect how representative the average rankings are by gender.

Color-coded horizontal bars and aligned y-axis labels make comparison between groups intuitive and clear.
