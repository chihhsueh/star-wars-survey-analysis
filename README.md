### Key Objectives:
- Clean and transform messy data (e.g., Booleans, checkboxes, column renaming)
- Identify the most-viewed and highest-rated *Star Wars* films
- Explore how opinions vary across gender and education level

This hands-on project demonstrates essential data wrangling and analysis skills relevant to real-world data analyst roles.

📊 Visual Example: Average Film Rankings
This horizontal bar chart displays the average viewer ranking of each Star Wars film (Episodes I–VI), based on survey responses from FiveThirtyEight’s dataset.

Lower scores indicate higher favorability (1 = most liked, 6 = least liked).

Episode V (The Empire Strikes Back) emerged as the most popular film on average.

Episode III (Revenge of the Sith) received the lowest overall ranking.

The chart uses customized colors, background styling, and annotation to enhance readability and highlight the ranking logic (lower = better).
